This application is pretty simple. We needed a way for users to login and request time 
off. There request would then be approved or denied by a manager. The system would allow
the user to login and view the history of there time off and any pending requests. 
There is also the ability to set maximum vacation time... 

Right now i am using RubyCAS client to authenticate a user. Once authenticated a User
model object gets created. 

TODO

I will add support for restful authentication so that more people can use this. 

Feel free to message me with any questions.
